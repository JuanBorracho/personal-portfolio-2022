# My Personal Portfolio 2022

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to design and then build a personal portfolio site to showcase my work.

My main aim was to practice a variety of new CSS skills and techniques that I have learned alongside using the BEM naming methodology and Sass for the first time.

The only Javascript used in this project is for the mobile menu and grid filters. I used vanilla Javascript (ES6).

I also wanted to gain experience using the build tool, Gulp, for the first time.

Below I will explain some of the techniques and technologies I have used as well as some of the challenges I faced during this project.
