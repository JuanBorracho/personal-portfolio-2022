/*
MEDIA QUERY MIXIN
Breakpoint arguments:

0px - 600px:      Phone
600px - 1020px:   Tablet
1020px - 1800px:  Normal styles
1800px plus:      Big desktop

Remember that em and rem units are not affected by the font-size property set in the html selector. They are only affected by the font size that comes from the browser. Therefore, 1 em is equal to 16px. We need to use em units in media queries because rem units do not work as intended in media queries.

Therefore, 600px divided by 16px = 37.5em
1020px divided by 16px = 63.75em
